## Overview
The UniqueLuxe Shoes platform serves as a digital storefront for handmade footwear. It combines a user-friendly frontend for browsing products with a secure backend for managing product data. The project also integrates containerization using Docker for easy deployment and CI/CD workflows to automate testing and delivery.

This project was designed not only to build a functional product but also to practice:
- **Full-stack development skills**
- **API integration**
- **Containerization & DevOps workflows**
- **Scalable application architecture**

---

## Key Objectives
1. **Build a Real-World Full-Stack App**  
   A working web application that mimics e-commerce product browsing and management.

2. **Focus on Developer Experience**  
   Use Docker Compose to make setup and teardown seamless.

3. **Automate Deployments**  
   With CI/CD workflows, code changes can be tested and deployed with minimal manual intervention.

4. **Keep the Code Modular and Reusable**  
   Each part of the stack (frontend, backend, devops) is organized for easy understanding and scalability.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```

.
├── backend/                # Backend logic, REST APIs, database connections
├── frontend/               # User-facing React or HTML/CSS/JS interface
├── .github/workflows/      # GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
├── docker-compose.yml      # Orchestrates frontend, backend, and database services
├── README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
└── LICENSE                 # Open-source license information
